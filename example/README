The following script is provided as practical example. It implements a loop connecting channel pairs in a loop (b1->c1, b2->c2, b3->c3)

Edit networks.xml adding the NETCONF access parameters for your device.

Usage:

python3 switch-loop-netconf.py --config=networks.xml --loops=10 | grep '^#'


Output:


Corresponding yangcli syntax based commandline to NETCONF PDUs script with identical functionality is also provided - switch-loop-yangcli.py:

Usage:

sudo python3 switch-loop-yangcli.py  | grep '^#'


The yangcli syntax makes configuration of YANG/NETCONF devices similar to programming SCPI command like instruments while converting to NETCONF is automated based on the YANG modules the device implements.
